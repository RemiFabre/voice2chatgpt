Perfect — here's a clean and minimal **README.md** you can include alongside your project to **document the working setup**, make it repeatable, and clarify what worked.

# 🐍 Whisper GPU Transcription Environment (CUDA 11.5 + cuDNN 8.3.2) (old versions that work on my ThinkPad)

This setup enables **faster-whisper** with full GPU acceleration on a system running:
- **CUDA 11.5**
- **cuDNN 8.3.2**
- **Python 3.10**
- A compatible NVIDIA GPU (e.g., RTX A2000 Mobile)

## ✅ Setup Instructions

### 1. Create and activate the virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv whisper
source whisper/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
````

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> The `requirements.txt` file was generated with a fully working configuration (see below).

### 3. Run a transcription

```python
from faster_whisper import WhisperModel

model = WhisperModel("medium", device="cuda", compute_type="float16")
segments, info = model.transcribe("your_audio.wav")

print("Detected language:", info.language)
for segment in segments:
    print(f"[{segment.start:.2f}s -> {segment.end:.2f}s] {segment.text}")
```

## 📁 Included Files

* `requirements.txt`: exact working versions of all Python packages
* `main.py`: example script to run transcription
* `README.md`: this file

## 💡 Notes

* You **do not need to set `PATH` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` manually** if your CUDA 11.5 and cuDNN 8.3.2 libraries are installed in system paths (e.g., `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`).
* Make sure no conflicting global versions of `onnxruntime` are installed.
* Tested with:

  * `onnxruntime-gpu==1.14.1`
  * `ctranslate2==3.24.0`
  * `faster-whisper==0.3.0`
  * `numpy==1.26.4`

## ♻️ To regenerate the environment

```bash
python3 -m venv whisper
source whisper/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run `main.py` or your custom scripts.
